With the advancement of technology, it is impossible to deny the fact that we live in the age of 
data. Seperating big data/Machine Learning from any industry is becoming more and more improbable.
The field of Medicine is no exception to this fact. Several efforts have been made to incorporate the advantages
of Machine learning and big data in the field of Medicine in the form of EMR and
AI algorithms to track onset of new diseases,Use of standardized data for development
of new drugs.Personalized medical services deal with comprehensive analysis of a 
variety of medical information of the patient such as personal health history, family history etc.This information
as of now is stored in th form of various scattered prescriptions,records all in the physical form.EMR tackles this problem
by creating an electronic record of all the information of the patient, which is now also being summarized into
one conclusive page with all the vital information.This enables doctors in the future to easily access all the required
information via EMR. This helps avoid uncertain diagonis. There have also been alot of success in the area
of predicting diseases in patients using EMR for example cardiac arrest was predicted in patients with pver 90% accurracy
.One of the issues with EMR is privacy and how it is easily be attacked by someone on the internet.Solutions to this
are provided in the form of blockchain hosted EMR and locally hosted EMR. These provide a secure way of maintaing digital
records while also giving the patient a certain amount of autonomy of their private data.Some countries like South Korea
and the USA have already adopted measures to integrate EMR into the national medical sectors and there is a good likelihood
of other countries to follow suit with upcoming research in the field.
