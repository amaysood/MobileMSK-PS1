Introduction to Git and GitHub is a comprehensive overview of the version control system Git 
and the collaborative platform GitHub. The course starts by explaining the fundamental concepts of version control 
and the benefits of using Git. It covers essential commands such as initializing a repository, committing changes, 
branching, merging, and resolving conflicts. Further into the course we have hands-on practice with GitHub, 
demonstrating how to create repositories, collaborate with others, and manage projects effectively. 
By the end of the course,I gained a solid understanding of Git and GitHub, enabling me 
to efficiently track and manage codebases and collaborate with other developers.
